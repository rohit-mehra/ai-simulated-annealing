# Implementation & Analysis: Simulated Annealing Algorithm

## Synopsis

This is a simulated annealing algorithm Implementation in a Jupyter notebook. Here, it is used to solve the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) between US state capitals. A brief consistency and temperature scheduling analysis is also done.

### Run Command

To launch the notebook, run the following command from a terminal with ptyhon3, jupyter installed and on the application path:

```
jupyter notebook Simulated_Annealing.ipynb
```
